## Files and Descriptions

### 1. `about_json.py`
This script demonstrates how to work with **JSON** data using Python's built-in `json` library. It covers tasks such as reading, parsing, and writing JSON data to files.

### 2. `csv_files.py`
This file provides examples of how to handle **CSV** (Comma-Separated Values) files using Python’s `csv` library. It demonstrates reading from and writing to CSV files with ease.

### 3. `input-output.py`
A practical file for learning basic **input and output** operations in Python. It shows how to read input from the user and write output to the console or files.

### 4. `iter.py`
This file delves into the concept of **iterators** in Python. It provides examples of creating and using iterators, and covers functions such as `iter()` and `next()`.

### 5. `jsfile.json`
A sample **JSON** file that contains an object. It’s used in conjunction with `about_json.py` to demonstrate how to load and manipulate JSON data in Python.

### 6. `lambda.py`
This script showcases the use of **lambda functions** in Python. It covers creating small anonymous functions with the `lambda` keyword for tasks like sorting, filtering, and transforming data.

### 7. `lists.py`
Contains various tips and methods for working with **lists** in Python. It explores list creation, slicing, and common list methods that can be used to manipulate list data.

### 8. `numbers.py`
This script highlights essential **number-related operations** in Python, including integer and floating-point calculations, as well as built-in functions for number manipulation.

### 9. `randoms.py`
A practical file for exploring the **`random`** library in Python. It includes examples of generating random numbers, selecting random items, and shuffling sequences.

### 10. `strings.py`
A comprehensive guide to **string manipulation** in Python. This file demonstrates various string methods for searching, formatting, and manipulating string data.

### 11. `system.py`
This script explores how to interact with the **system environment** using the `sys` and `os` libraries. It includes system-level operations like file management and command-line argument parsing.

### 12. `text-files.py`
Learn how to **read from and write to text files** in Python. This file demonstrates file handling, including opening, reading, writing, and closing text files.

### 13. `yield.py`
An introduction to the `yield` keyword in Python. This file demonstrates how to create **generators** and how to use `yield` to return values lazily within a function.
